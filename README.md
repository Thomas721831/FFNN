# FFNN
This repository presents a comparative analysis of three activation functions—ReLU, Sigmoid, and LeakyReLU—implemented within a customized feedforward neural network (FFNN) architecture. The study evaluates their performance in a regression setting using diagnostic metrics and visualizations.
Data
Please download the  directory, which contains four subfolders. Each subfolder includes 300 MRI brain scan images used for training and evaluation.
